## Model curation

Scripts for curating different parts of the model.

Curations between each model release are gathered in consolidated curation scripts that are named after the model version that they are curation. E.g. v8_6_0.m includes updates that should be applied to model version 8.6.0 to result in the next model release.

TEMPLATEcuration.m is the template script that should be used to generate a new consolidated curation script after a new model has just been released.

In addition, this folder contains generic functions that are useful for model curation. These functions should be written in a generic format, so that they could be reused for future curations.
