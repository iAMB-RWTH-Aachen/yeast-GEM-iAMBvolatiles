## Model curation

Data files used for performing curations to the model.

Organized in folders that indicate to which model version the changes should be applied. E.g. 'v8_6_0' contains data files to curate model version 8.6.0 (but note that it does not specify the version number of the _new_ model).

The data files here mainly exist of list with reactions, metabolites etc., and their annotations.

Data that conceivably could be used repeatedly (so not only to curate one specific model version), might be better kept in ../physiology or ../databases.
